# HierarchicalClustering
# PROJECT TITLE
Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of American Mall Market called as phoenix mall to findout on the basis of clinet requirement of Dendrograms using scioy libraries with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierarchy",to ace the number of linkage of clustering to predict.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The American Finance market clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market.

As a Datascience Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.

# TASKS

Task1

With the help of scipy library import library and datasets.

Task2

Using the Dendrograms find the optimal number of clusters

Task3

Create a Hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with help of matplot library

# CONCLUSION

According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is that cluster number 3 has the highest nnumber of linkage.

# INSIGHTS

 (1)Cluster1 contains (Red)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucliding distance from the centroid upto Annual income approximately 139k$.

(2)Cluster2 contains (Blue)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 79 to 80k$.

(3)Cluster2 contains (Green)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 139$.

(4)Cluster2 contains (cyan)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 40k$.

(5)Cluster2 contains (magneta)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluding distance from centroid upto annual income approximately 40k$.
